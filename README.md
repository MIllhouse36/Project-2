## Description
GameSwap is an application developed for console gamers to trade games with other gamers. Simply make an account, search for games that you own, and then add them to your collection. You can then seach the database for games that you want to play and then will be shown a list of other users that have that game available for trade.

## Usage
Go to https://project2-rmdm.herokuapp.com/ to create an account. After an account is created, you can then search for a game title, choose the platform for the title, and click the search button. When the list is populated, you have a choice of adding the game to your collection by clicking "Add Game" (meaning you have it and want to trade it off) or click "Find Game" to show a list of users that already have the game and are willing to trade it for another game. 
Clicking "Add Game" will add it to your collection and then redirect you to your personal collection where you can see everything you currently have up for trade. To remove a game, simply click "Delete Game."
After clicking "Find Game," users with that game up for trade will be displayed in a list. If you click their name, their full collection of games currently up for trade will show with a button at the top that opens up your email application to send them a request to trade games.
